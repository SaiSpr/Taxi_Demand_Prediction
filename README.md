ðŸš– Taxi Demand Predictor Project ðŸš€

Explore the fascinating world of predicting NYC taxi demand with this end-to-end time series ML project! Predict the next hour's ride count, helping taxi companies bridge the supply-demand gap and serve users better. We've sourced data from the NYC government's "TLC Trip Record Data" from January 2022 to June 2023.

ðŸ“Š Sample Data:
Take a sneak peek at the dataset, with a focus on 'tpep_pickup_datetime' and 'PULocationID'. These columns are pivotal for forecasting ride numbers. We've even crafted a 'number_of_rides' column through smart grouping.

ðŸ“ˆ Methodology:

    Preprocessing: Introduce new time slots missing in the original data.
    Modeling: Experiment with baseline estimators, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Guess what? LightGBM ruled the roost!
    Featurestore Magic: Leverage Hopsworks Featurestore to house features and models.
    GitHub Journey: Find the code on GitHub.
    Interactive Frontend: Dive into the Streamlit-powered app, featuring NYC's map with dark green zones highlighting high ride predictions, including the next ten hours.
